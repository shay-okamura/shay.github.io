About Me
Hi, My name is Shay and I'm currently enrolled in M.I.T. Professional Certificate in Coding Program. I'm currently working in the Restaurant and Hospitality Industry and trying to expand my horizions and learn a new trade. WHen I'm not working or learning coding I'm out having an adventure with my boy, Kenobi.
This page serves as a portfolio page to showcase my work and hopefully allows me to demonstrate the growth of my skills and experiences.
